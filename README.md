# volve-machine-learning

This repository is my exploration on bringing machine learning to Volve oil field open dataset disclosed by Equinor since 2018. For more information about this dataset and how to access the original database, see [here](https://www.equinor.com/en/how-and-why/digitalisation-in-our-dna/volve-field-data-village-download.html).

#### Machine learning projects (current and upcoming):

* [P-sonic (DT) log prediction in well 15/9-F-11B and 15/9-F-1C]()
* S-sonic (DTS) log imputation 
* Unsupervised classification for facies typing

## P-sonic (DT) log prediction in well 15/9-F-11B and 15/9-F-1C

Regressors in *Scikit-Learn* used are: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors
The best regressor performance achieved is Gradient Boosting.
